# Claim and Debtor Management 
The project's goal is to excute a web application that uses matching software for the purpose of managing finances at a hospital. The intention is to provide a tool for the hospital's claim assessor to identify which patient was which patient when the social security funds sent the claim statement back to the hospital, so the hospital can estimate whether the cost of treating that patient caused the hospital to lose profit or sell at cost.
